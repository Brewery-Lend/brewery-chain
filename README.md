Brewery Chain is a specialized Layer 3 rollup solution built on Espresso Systems technology, designed specifically for enabling micro-lending using NFTs as collateral. Our chain creates a seamless, efficient, and secure environment for fractional NFT ownership and lending while maintaining low transaction costs.

## Overview
